# Disease-and-Flight-Travel-Modelling

The project implements adaptive tau, easy abc, abc, and my own code to fit parameters and model within country dynamics and international dynamics for mcr1 and ndm1.

The repository also includes the datasets that I collected from studies of mcr1 and ndm1 outbreaks, including the date and location of these outbreaks among other variables.
